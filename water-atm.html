            <h1>Why Water ATM?</h1>

            <p>Water has become a precious resource in Pakistan. While a World Bank report estimated that Pakistan would cross into water scarcity in the year 2035, it has far exceeded this timeline, having crossed  into water scarcity in 2010<cite><a href="Citations/Pakistan's Water Economy Running Dry.pdf" >[1]</a></cite> . The demand for water in Pakistan is rising as supply stagnates. According to the UN World Water Development Report of 2009, Pakistan has the highest water utilization rate in the world, with the ratio of freshwater withdrawal to total water resources being 308%  <cite><a href="Citations/UN-Water_Annual_Report_2009.pdf">[2]</a></cite>.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the water available to Pakistani’s via public water taps is often contaminated. Pakistan’s Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR's 2015) reported 69% of samples collected from 23 cities throughout Pakistan were unsafe to drink due to bacterial, arsenic, and iron contamination<cite><a href="Citations/Water Quality Statu of Major Cities of Pakistan 2015-16.pdf" >[3]</a></cite>. The absence of enforced water quality standards and regular monitoring programs have also contributed to the increased in pollution of drinking water.</p>

            <p>Lack of access to clean and reliable drinking water has a multitude of ill effects in communities. Bacterial water contamination is culprit in the spread of Cholera, Typhoid, and Hepatitis. An estimated 250,000 children die of diarrhea and Typhoid in Pakistan each year <cite><a href="https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/04/17/polluted-water-causes-40-of-deaths-in-pakistan-annually/ " >[4]</a></cite>. </p>

            <p>The Supreme Court of Pakistan has declared, not only that the fundamental right to life includes a clean and healthy environment, but that access to unpolluted water is the right of every person wherever they live. In order to deliver on this right, Pakistan needs to adopt water management and conservation techniques to ensure it’s people have and will continue to have access to water.</p>
            
            <p>Water demand management is a practical means of meeting water needs as it does not require large investments in expanding water sources, and consequently does not exploit natural resources that are unable to sustain the rapidly increase in water usage. The goal is to keep demand below the carrying ability of the water resources available <cite><a href="Citations/Water as an economic good and demand management.pdf">[5]</a></cite> .</p>

            <p>The Water ATM, an autonomous water dispensing and quality monitoring unit, would be installed at public government funded water taps where Pakistani’s come to collect water. It would measure the amount of water collected by each household via RFID cards that are provided to each family and collect real time water quality data that would inform the filtration plant of any change in water quality and need for intervention.</p>
